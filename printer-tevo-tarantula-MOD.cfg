[extruder]
step_pin: ar26
dir_pin: !ar28
enable_pin: !ar24
step_distance: .00222
nozzle_diameter: 0.400
#   Diameter of the nozzle orifice (in mm). This parameter must be
#   provided.
filament_diameter: 1.750
#max_extrude_cross_section:
#   Maximum area of the cross section of an extrusion line (in
#   mm^2). This setting prevents excessive amounts of extrusion during
#   relatively small XY moves. If a move requests an extrusion rate
#   that would exceed this value it will cause an error to be
#   returned. The default is: 4.0 * nozzle_diameter^2
#max_extrude_only_distance: 50.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that an extrude only move
#   may be. If an extrude only move requests a distance greater than
#   this value it will cause an error to be returned. The default is
#   50mm.
#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the extruder motor for extrude only
#   moves. If this is not specified then it is calculated to match the
#   limit an XY printing move with a max_extrude_cross_section
#   extrusion would have.
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the extruder motor for extrude
#   only moves. If this is not specified then it is calculated to
#   match the limit an XY printing move with a
#   max_extrude_cross_section extrusion would have.
#pressure_advance: 0.0
#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during
#   extruder acceleration. An equal amount of filament is retracted
#   during deceleration. It is measured in millimeters per
#   millimeter/second. The default is 0, which disables pressure
#   advance.
#pressure_advance_lookahead_time: 0.010
#   A time (in seconds) to "look ahead" at future extrusion moves when
#   calculating pressure advance. This is used to reduce the
#   application of pressure advance during cornering moves that would
#   otherwise cause retraction followed immediately by pressure
#   buildup. This setting only applies if pressure_advance is
#   non-zero. The default is 0.010 (10 milliseconds).
#
# The remaining variables describe the extruder heater.
heater_pin: ar7
#   PWM output pin controlling the heater. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   heater_pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set
#   fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would
#   allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This
#   setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended
#   periods) to the heater. The default is 1.0.

#pid_Ki: 2.19
#pid_Kd: 66.86
min_extrude_temp: 170
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 250
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. This check can help detect some
#   heater and sensor hardware failures. Set this range just wide
#   enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an
#   error. These parameters must be provided.

max_accel: 1500
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_z_velocity: 10
#   For cartesian printers this sets the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of
#   movement along the z axis. This setting can be used to restrict
#   the maximum speed of the z stepper motor on cartesian
#   printers. The default is to use max_velocity for max_z_velocity.
max_z_accel: 200
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The default is 5mm/s.



# BLTouch probe. One may define this section (instead of a probe
# section) to enable a BLTouch probe. (Note! This bltouch module may
# not work correctly with some BLTouch "clones"!) A virtual
# "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin is also created (see the "probe"
# section above for the details).

#   provided.

#   move up or down. The default is 0.200 seconds.
x_offset: 39
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: -21
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0.

#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
speed: 1.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.

# Mesh Bed Leveling. One may define a [bed_mesh] config section
# to enable move transformations that offset the z axis based
# on a mesh generated from probed points. Note that bed_mesh
# and bed_tilt are incompatible, both cannot be defined.
# BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
[bed_mesh]
speed: 50
#   The default is 50.
min_point: 0,40
#   An X,Y point defining the minimum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Note that this refers to the nozzle position,
#   and take care that you do not define a point that will move
#   the probe off of the bed. This parameter must be provided.
max_point: 150,275
#   An X,Y point defining the maximum coordinate to probe on
#   the bed. Follow the same precautions as listed in min_point.
#   Also note that this does not necessarily define the last point
#   probed, only the maximum coordinate. This parameter must be provided.
probe_count: 3,4
#   A comma separated pair of integer values (X,Y) defining the number
#   of points to probe along each axis. A single value is also valid,
#   in which case that value will be for both axes. Default is 3,3
#   which probes a 3x3 grid.
samples: 3
#   The number of times to probe each point.  The probed z-values
#   will be averaged.  The default is to probe 1 time.
